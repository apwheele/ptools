Description: Functions used for analyzing count data, mostly crime counts. Includes checking difference in two Poisson counts (e-test), checking the fit for a Poisson distribution, small sample tests for counts in bins (e.g. days of week, or can be applied to Benfords law), Wheeler & Ratcliffe's WDD test <doi:10.1186/s40163-018-0085-5> to evaluate crime changes over time in treated/control areas. Additionally includes functions for aggregating spatial data and spatial feature engineering.
