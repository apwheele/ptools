Description: Some functions I have used for analyzing count data, mostly crime counts. Includes checking difference in two Poisson counts (e-test), checking the fit for a Poisson distribution. Functions to calculate small sample tests for counts in bins (e.g. days of week, or can be applied to Benfords law). And functions for Wheeler & Ratcliffe's WDD test to evaluate crime changes over time in treated/control areas.
